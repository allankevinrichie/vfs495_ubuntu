pam_fprint is a PAM module which uses libfprint's fingerprint verification
functionality to implement a fingerprint-based login system.

Before you can use pam_fprint to login, you must have enrolled at least one
finger on the device that you wish to use (or a compatible one).
A program called pam_fprint_enroll is provided that does this for you.
Run with the --help argument to learn how to enroll different fingers.

pam_fprint is alpha software and has deficiencies.

See the the homepage for PAM setup instructions and other notes.
